    "An array of floating point values that the model ingests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually feature-vectors use processed representations of the dataset’s values.\n",

    "## Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting numerical values into a standard range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature X may span values between 1 and 121 (like Age)\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Y may span values between 101 and 100000 (like monthly salary)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Normalize?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Models converge more quickly (Gradient descent may bounce if features have different ranges)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Infer better predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoid NaN trap — when feature value exceeds floating-point precision limit, the system sets the value to NaN.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn appropriate weights for each feature — Otherwise, the Model may pay too much attention to features with large ranges and larger values, compared to features with narrow ranges and smaller values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Normalization Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Linear scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Convert values from their natural range to a standard range such as 0 to 1 or -1 to +1.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x' = (x - x_{min}) / (x_{max} - x_{min}) \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Good for features like: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Features like `Age`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Age has tight upper and lower bound. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Few outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bad for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Features like `Net Worth`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- No good upper bound. Keeps changing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extremely wide range of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Several outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Values aren’t uniformly distributed across the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Z-Score scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "A Z-score is the number of standard deviations from the mean. A value with a Z-score of +2.0 means that the value is 2 std above mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x' = (x - μ) / σ\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "σ = std ; μ = mean ; x’ = z-score ; x = original value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normally distributed feature like `height`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Z-scoring is a decent choice for `Net Worth`. Not the best because most of the normally distributed values of Net Worth lie in a smaller range (maybe $10k to $100k per year range), while other values are outliers. And the outliers can be huge. **Clipping** can help in this situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bad for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Features with Logarithmic distributions, exponential distributions or hyperbolic functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Log scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Computes logarithm of the raw value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually `ln` or natural log is used i.e. Log to the base `e`. (e = 2.71828…)\n",
    "\n",
    "Good for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Features following Power-Law distribution or Zipf’s law.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Any feature that has ratings, or a frequency / ranking of some kind will usually be a goof candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Examples: # of Movie ratings, Frequency of Word usage, City populations, Website traffic, Search engine usage etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bad for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Features following a normal distribution or a tightly bound linear range.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Clipping\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually caps the value of outliers to a specific max value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Distributions which are mainly normal, but not completely normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Several extreme outliers, but most values are in a relatively narrow/moderate range.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can be combined with Z-scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bad for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the outliers are fewer, and not mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conversely, when the data is heavily tailed. Most values are on extreme ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The outliers are the values of interest — for example when detecting fraud or anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When domain knowledge suggests keeping outliers.\n"

However we are less concerned with 36.2 degrees vs 37.1 degrees, and more concerned with a temperature of 32 and above, vs a temp range of 20 - 28, which is seen as a comfortable outdoor temperature.\n",

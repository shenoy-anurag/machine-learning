    "Remember that when the Determinant is Zero, it means that atleast one of the N basis vectors in the N-dimensional space can be written as a Linear combination of the other vectors, thus indicating that the vectors are linearly dependent, and thus atleast one of the vectors' effect can be explained by a combination of the other vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the number of basis vectors required to cover each and every point in the new transformed space, is less than N-dimensions.\n",
